## Chapter 14: Allergies & Anaphylaxis 

1. List four routes by which an allergen may enter the body.
2. List four potential allergy causes.
3. List the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction.
4. Demonstrate the steps for properly using portable epinephrine auto-injectors.

## 14.1 List four routes by which an allergen may enter the body.

1. **Inhalation**: Breathing in allergens like pollen, dust, mold, or animal dander.
2. **Ingestion**: Consuming allergens in foods, beverages, or medications.
3. **Injection**: Introduction of allergens via a needle, such as from insect stings, injections, or medications (e.g., penicillin).
4. **Absorption (Contact)**: Allergens entering through the skin, such as from contact with plants like poison ivy or latex.

## 14.2 List four potential allergy causes.

1. **Food**: Common food allergens include peanuts, shellfish, eggs, milk, and wheat.
2. **Medications**: Drugs like penicillin, aspirin, or certain antibiotics can cause allergic reactions.
3. **Insect Stings/Bites**: Reactions from bee stings, wasp stings, or bites from ants.
4. **Environmental Allergens**: Pollen, dust mites, mold, pet dander, and other airborne allergens.

These allergens can trigger a variety of allergic reactions, from mild to life-threatening (anaphylaxis).

## 14.3 List the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction.

The **signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction** can vary from mild to severe, and include:

1. **Hives** or red, itchy skin rash.
2. **Swelling** of the face, lips, tongue, or throat (angioedema).
3. **Itching** or tingling sensations, particularly around the mouth or affected areas.
4. **Sneezing, nasal congestion**, or runny nose.
5. **Watery, itchy eyes**.
6. **Difficulty breathing** or shortness of breath.
7. **Wheezing** or coughing.
8. **Nausea, vomiting**, or diarrhea.
9. **Abdominal pain or cramping**.
10. **Dizziness or lightheadedness**.
11. **Rapid or weak pulse**.
12. **Anxiety** or feeling of impending doom (often seen in severe reactions).
13. **Anaphylaxis**: A severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that includes airway swelling, severe breathing difficulties, a drop in blood pressure (shock), and loss of consciousness.

**Anaphylaxis** is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment with **epinephrine** and emergency medical care.









## 14.4 Demonstrate the steps for properly using portable epinephrine auto-injectors.


Here’s a step-by-step guide to properly using a **portable epinephrine auto-injector** (e.g., EpiPen, Auvi-Q) in the event of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis):

### **Steps to Use an Epinephrine Auto-Injector**:

1. **Identify the Need**:
   - Recognize signs of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, or other severe allergic symptoms.
   - If in doubt, use the epinephrine auto-injector. It’s better to use it early if anaphylaxis is suspected.

2. **Prepare the Auto-Injector**:
   - Remove the **safety cap** or **safety release** from the device (varies depending on the brand).
   - Hold the auto-injector firmly with your **dominant hand**. Make sure your hand is positioned according to the device’s instructions (e.g., thumb NOT over the top).

3. **Position the Device**:
   - The injection is meant for the **outer thigh**. It can be administered through clothing if necessary.
   - Place the injector firmly against the outer thigh, at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular to the thigh).

4. **Administer the Injection**:
   - Press the auto-injector firmly into the thigh until you hear a **click** (this indicates the needle has deployed).
   - Hold the auto-injector in place for **3 to 10 seconds** (depending on the device’s instructions) to ensure the full dose is delivered.

5. **Remove the Injector**:
   - After the injection is complete, remove the injector from the thigh and massage the injection site for a few seconds to help with medication absorption.

6. **Seek Emergency Help**:
   - Immediately call **911** or emergency services after using the auto-injector, as the effects of epinephrine may wear off and additional medical care may be needed.
   - If symptoms persist or worsen after **5-15 minutes**, a second dose may be administered (if available and per healthcare instructions).

7. **Dispose of the Auto-Injector**:
   - Place the used auto-injector in its **carrying case** or a **sharps container** and give it to healthcare professionals upon arrival.

### **Important Notes**:
- **Do not delay** using the epinephrine auto-injector in case of suspected anaphylaxis. Early intervention is key.
- **Hold the device properly**: Never place your thumb or hand over the end of the auto-injector to avoid accidental injection into your hand.
- Always have an **extra auto-injector** available, as some severe allergic reactions may require more than one dose.

Proper use of the epinephrine auto-injector can save a life in cases of severe allergic reactions. Always follow up with medical professionals after use.
